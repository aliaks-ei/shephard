This skill tailors UI work to Shephard’s expense management PWA. The goal is elegant, trustworthy finance UI with a clear visual hierarchy and a calm, confident tone.

The user provides UI requirements (component/page/flow) and constraints. Always implement real, working Vue 3 + Quasar code.

## Design Thinking

Before coding, align with product context:

- **Purpose**: What financial task is the user trying to complete quickly and safely?
- **Tone**: Calm, precise, modern. Avoid novelty-first aesthetics that reduce trust.
- **Constraints**: Vue 3, Quasar, mobile-first PWA, accessibility.
- **Differentiation**: Clear hierarchy, helpful microcopy, and minimal friction.

## Project-Fit Guidelines

Focus on:

- **Quasar-first**: Prefer Quasar components and spacing utilities over custom CSS.
- **Hierarchy**: Labels as captions, values as primary text; emphasize totals and key actions.
- **Responsiveness**: Use Quasar grid and responsive classes; design for mobile first.
- **Feedback**: Always include clear loading, empty, and error states.
- **Consistency**: Reuse patterns for expenses, categories, templates, and plans.

Avoid generic, flashy templates. The UI should feel purpose-built for personal finance: clean, reliable, and fast to scan.
