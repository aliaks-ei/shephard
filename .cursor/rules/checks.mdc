Before considering yourself done, make sure there are no linting or formatting issues, and that unit tests pass entirely.

Here are the commands you should run:

1. `npm run lint` – finds linting issues. If the command terminates with no linting issues surfaced, you're good to go.
2. `npm run format` – reformats the code to follow our prettier formatting rules. You should just run it before running type check.
3. `npm run type-check` – run type checking. If the command terminates with no type issues surfaced, you're good to go.
