Before considering work complete, ensure all quality checks pass. These checks maintain code quality, security, and functionality standards.

## Required Quality Checks

1. **Linting**: `npm run lint` – Identifies code style issues, potential bugs, and anti-patterns

   - Must terminate with zero linting errors
   - Address all warnings where practical
   - Follow project's ESLint configuration

2. **Formatting**: `npm run format` – Ensures consistent code formatting across the codebase

   - Run before committing changes
   - Uses Prettier with project-specific configuration
   - Formats TypeScript, Vue, SCSS, HTML, MD, and JSON files

3. **Unit Tests**: `npm run test:unit:ci` – Validates functionality and prevents regressions
   - All tests must pass completely
   - Maintain or improve test coverage
   - Fix failing tests before considering work complete
